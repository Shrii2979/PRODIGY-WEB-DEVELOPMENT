3.Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

The Tic Tac Toe Application is a classic game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a digital rendition of the timeless tic-tac-toe game, showcasing my skills in implementing game logic and user interactions in a web-based environment.

The game features a responsive and visually appealing interface, allowing users to play against a computer opponent or another player. JavaScript is used to handle game mechanics, including checking for win conditions, handling player moves, and determining the outcome of each match.

Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in JavaScript programming, algorithmic thinking, and user interface design. It highlights my ability to create interactive and engaging web-based games that provide entertainment and challenge to users.
