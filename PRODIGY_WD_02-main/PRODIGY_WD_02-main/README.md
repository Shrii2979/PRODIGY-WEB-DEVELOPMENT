2.Stopwatch Application:

The Stopwatch Application is a functional web-based tool developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its primary functionality is to allow users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch, making it a practical utility for timing various activities.

The application features a simple yet intuitive user interface, with clear controls for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch. JavaScript is utilized to handle the stopwatch logic, including tracking elapsed time and updating the display in real-time.

This project showcases my proficiency in JavaScript programming, particularly in managing state and handling user interactions within a web application. It demonstrates my ability to create functional and user-friendly web tools that serve practical purposes.
